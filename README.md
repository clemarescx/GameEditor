# GameEditor
A campaign editor in C# and the WPF framework for an arbitrary Zelda-like game for creating a topdown adventure game.

## Very much WIP...

The DatabaseManager module is not linked to the campaign editor. It's more a proof of competence to use MongoDB with C#, but the end goal is for assets created by the editor (characters, campaigns, maps...) to be saved in an online MongoDB repository and accessible with clients sharing the same link to the repository.
